# Task 7
# Modify the value of the weight of the state B to 0.5. 
# PLot the evolution of the population for 15 steps based on sequence "S". 
# Answer the question: Does the population survive after 15 steps?
# Write a report which must contain the plot of these 15 steps and the answer to the quesstion.
